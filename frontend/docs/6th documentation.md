Great â€” now weâ€™re designing the **entire technical workflow** for the genomic platform as a **layered architecture** (Frontend â†” Backend â†” Off-chain Python â†” Database â†” On-chain Clarity smart contracts).

Weâ€™ll group everything into **Basic**, **Medium**, and **Complex**, so you see how the project grows over time without code yet.

## ðŸŸ¢ **Basic Workflow (MVP Stage)**

Focus: Core user flow, minimal blockchain hooks, and basic classical analysis.

**1. Frontend (Vite + React + TS + CSS Modules)**

* Pages: Home, Login/Register, Upload DNA/RNA, Results page.
* User registers/logs in.
* Uploads a DNA/RNA file â†’ request analysis.
* Sees analysis result summary.

**2. Backend (Node.js + Express + TS)**

* Handles API requests from frontend.
* Routes: `/auth`, `/upload`, `/analysis`.
* Sends uploaded file to Python service.
* Stores metadata + hash in MongoDB/SQL.
* Calls **Clarity contracts (via stacks.js)** for:

  * User identity (register).
  * Data registry (store dataset hash).
  * Subscription (check user access).

**3. Off-chain Python Service**

* Classical analysis pipeline: alignment, GC content, mutation detection.
* Returns result hash + summary back to Node backend.

**4. Database (MongoDB/Postgres)**

* Stores: user profiles, dataset metadata, result hashes.
* Blockchain stores hashes (immutability), DB stores full data.

**5. On-chain (Clarity Smart Contracts)**

  * Marketplace (buy/sell datasets, tools).
  * Education portal (courses + token rewards).
  * Forensics/agriculture dashboard.
  * Reputation profiles for labs/clinics.
* Integrated experience: clinicians, students, researchers, farmers all use one platform.

**2. Backend**

  * Token issuance/redemption workflows.
  * Marketplace transactions.
  * Provenance tracking.
  * Reputation scoring logic (linked to on-chain).

* Generates unique result hashes to anchor proofs on-chain.

**4. Database**

* Stores:

  * Marketplace listings & transaction metadata.
  * Education progress & token records.
  * Provenance samples & chain-of-custody.
  * Reputation scores (with hashes on-chain).

**5. On-chain Contracts**

* `reputation-system.clar`: Track reliability of users.
* `education-tokens.clar`: Mint tokens for learning achievements.
* `provenance-forensics.clar`: Store sample hashes for forensics/agriculture.

Would you like me to **turn this into a diagram (architecture flow chart)** so you visually see how frontend â†” backend â†” python â†” database â†” contracts all interact at each stage?

Perfect ðŸš€ Letâ€™s design the **entire workflow of the project** â€” how the **frontend (Vite React + TypeScript)**, **backend (Node/Express + TypeScript)**, **Python services (ML/AI/analysis)**, **database (MongoDB/Postgres)**, and **smart contracts (Clarity on Stacks + Oracles)** **communicate with each other**.

Weâ€™ll structure this into **Basic â†’ Medium â†’ Complex** phases, so the platform evolves step by step.

# ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow (Technical, No Code Yet)

## **1. Basic Workflow**

ðŸ”— Goal: Make sure **core client interactions** work: input â†’ backend â†’ database â†’ output.

**Flow:**

1. **Frontend (Vite React + TypeScript)**

   * Users can:

     * Sign up / log in.
     * Upload simple data (DNA/RNA sequences as plain text or CSV).
     * View basic results and reports.

2. **Backend (Node/Express + TypeScript)**

   * Handles:

     * Authentication (JWT).
     * Routing requests from frontend to services.
