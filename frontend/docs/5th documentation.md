Great — below is a focused, practical **Clarity smart-contract design spec** for your platform (no code). I’ll list the contracts you’ll need, what each is responsible for, the key state they hold, the high-level functions they expose, the access model/roles, how they interact with oracles & off-chain systems, testing & deployment notes, and security & compliance considerations.

Use this as the definitive blueprint for writing Clarity contracts later (or handing to a Clarity developer).

# 📜 Clarity Contracts Blueprint (High level, no code)

## Overview — contracts you’ll want

1. **Data Provenance Contract** (`data-provenance`)
2. **Payments / Credits Contract** (`payments`)
3. **Access Control & Permissions Contract** (`access-control`)
4. **Sequence Registry** (`sequence-registry`)
5. **Oracle Bridge Contract** (`oracle-bridge`)
6. **Marketplace / Tool Licensing Contract** (`marketplace`)
7. **Governance / DAO Contract** (`governance`)
8. **Auditing & Logging Contract** (`audit-log`)
9. **Optional: Token Wrapper or Escrow Contract** (`escrow`)

Each contract should be small and focused (single responsibility). Compose rather than monolith: have contracts call one another or reference each other via principal addresses.

---

## 1) Data Provenance Contract (`data-provenance`)

**Purpose:** record immutable proofs (hashes) of uploaded sequences, link to on-chain metadata, and store minimal references so heavy data stays off-chain.

**On-chain state (minimal):**

* Mapping: `sequence-hash -> metadata-record`

  * `metadata-record` includes: uploader principal, timestamp, pointer to off-chain storage (IPFS CID or URL hash), analysis result hash, optional tag (e.g., “clinical”, “research”).
* Sequence counter / index (for enumeration).

**Key functions (high-level):**

* `record-sequence-proof(uploader, sequenceHash, storagePointer, tags)` — store proof, only callable by authorized uploader or oracle.
* `get-sequence-proof(sequenceHash)` — read metadata.
* `revoke-proof(sequenceHash)` — limited use (rare); only admins and highly audited (for GDPR erasure workflows; see compliance notes).
* `list-sequences(page, pageSize)` — read-only enumeration (subject to public/private flags).

**Access model:**

* Public read for transparency (or gated read for private data).
* Writes only by registered services: uploader principal OR the Oracle contract (signed), or via `access-control` verification.

**Notes:**

* Store only cryptographic hashes and minimal metadata on-chain; do **not** store raw sequences nor PHI.

---

## 2) Payments / Credits Contract (`payments`)

**Purpose:** let users pay for analyses (one-off or subscription), manage credits, and route funds to service providers. Use STX as the native currency or integrate a wrapped token if needed.

**On-chain state:**

* Balances ledger for credits (user -> credit balance).
* Mapping: jobId -> payment record (payer, amount, timestamp, serviceType).
* Pricing table (serviceType -> price in STX).

**Key functions:**

* `buy-credits(user, amount)` — deposit STX and credit user off-chain usage units.
* `pay-for-job(user, jobId, serviceType)` — escrow payment for a job; funds held until oracle confirms job completion.
* `release-payment(jobId)` — called by oracle upon successful completion to release STX to provider.
* `refund(jobId)` — in case of failure (governed by dispute resolution).
* `set-pricing(admin, serviceType, price)` — admin only.

**Access model & flows:**

* Users call `buy-credits` via stacks.js (wallet).
* When user submits a job, backend calls `pay-for-job` to escrow funds.
* Oracle verifies result and calls `release-payment`.

**Notes:**

* Consider an on-chain escrow to ensure trustless release.
* Keep logic simple to minimize gas and avoid complex on-chain dispute code — heavy dispute resolution can be handled off-chain via governance.

---

## 3) Access Control & Permissions (`access-control`)

**Purpose:** centralize roles and data access policies (who can view which `sequence-registry` entries, who can request clinical reports, etc.).

**On-chain state:**

* Role registry: principal -> role set (e.g., `ADMIN`, `CLINIC`, `RESEARCHER`, `ORACLE`, `GOVERNANCE`).
* ACL rules: resource identifier -> allowed roles or principals.
* Consent records: `sequenceHash -> consentFlags` (e.g., `shareWithPublic`, `shareWithResearchers`).

**Key functions:**

* `grant-role(admin, principal, role)` / `revoke-role(admin, principal, role)`
* `set-resource-acl(resourceId, allowedRoles)`
* `record-consent(sequenceHash, consentData)` — used to store user consent flags (consent should be hashed + pointer; sensitive fields off-chain).
* `can-access(principal, resourceId)` — read-only check.

**Access model:**

* Admins (governance or platform ops) can add/remove roles.
* `data-provenance` and `sequence-registry` consult this contract to decide whether to reveal pointers.

**Notes:**

* Carefully design consent model to satisfy regulatory requirements (GDPR data subject rights) — see security/compliance section.

---

## 4) Sequence Registry (`sequence-registry`)

**Purpose:** registry of anonymized sequence entries, lineage tags, public flags, and pointers to on-chain proofs.

**On-chain state:**

* `entryId -> {sequenceHash, provenanceTxId, publicFlag, tags, ownerPrincipal}`
* Indexes by tag/organism/disease for light querying.

**Key functions:**

* `register-sequence(entry)` — called after `data-provenance.record-sequence-proof`.
* `set-public(entryId, bool)` — toggles whether the entry is discoverable publicly.
* `query-by-tag(tag, page)` — read-only.

**Access model:**

* Writes generally via oracle or backend after job completion; reads public if `publicFlag` set.

**Notes:**

* Keep queries limited — Clarity is not for complex search. Use off-chain indexing services for heavy queries and store only pointers on-chain.

---

## 5) Oracle Bridge Contract (`oracle-bridge`)

**Purpose:** coordinate oracle-signed updates (results, price changes, reference DB updates) and provide a secure authorized entrypoint for oracle reports.

**On-chain state:**

* Authorized oracle principals list.
* Pending oracle jobs mapping (jobId -> status).

**Key functions:**

* `register-oracle(admin, oraclePrincipal)`
* `oracle-report(jobId, resultHash, metadata)` — only callable by authorized oracle principals.
* `get-job-status(jobId)`

**Oracle integration pattern:**

* Oracle signs or publishes job results off-chain, then invokes `oracle-report` on-chain to log results and trigger payment release via `payments` contract.

**Security:**

* Only minimal logic here; verify caller is authorized oracle principal. Consider multi-oracle confirmation for high-value actions.

---

## 6) Marketplace / Tool Licensing Contract (`marketplace`)

**Purpose:** allow third-party tool authors (pipelines, notebooks) to list services; manage licensing, pay-per-use, revenue share.

**On-chain state:**

* `toolId -> {owner, price, metadataPointer, activeFlag}`
* Sales ledger (toolId, buyer, tx)

**Key functions:**

* `list-tool(owner, metadataPointer, price)`
* `purchase-tool(buyer, toolId)` — handles payment and grants access (maybe a tokenized license or an off-chain entitlement recorded on-chain).
* `set-revenue-split(toolId, shares)`

**Access model:**

* Tool usage enforcement typically off-chain (access tokens) but the purchase recorded on-chain.

**Notes:**

* Keep license enforcement off-chain; use on-chain proof for purchases & dispute resolution.

---

## 7) Governance / DAO Contract (`governance`)

**Purpose:** platform-level governance — decision making about pricing, oracle registration, whitelists, and major upgrades.

**On-chain state:**

* Proposal list (proposalId -> details, proposer, votes)
* Voting weights (based on STX stake or governance token)

**Key functions:**

* `create-proposal(proposer, proposalData)`
* `vote(proposalId, vote)`
* `execute-proposal(proposalId)` (if passed)

**Notes:**

* Governance design depends on your tokenomics. For MVP, governance can be small and off-chain.

---

## 8) Auditing & Logging Contract (`audit-log`)

**Purpose:** lightweight append-only log for important platform events (e.g., data consent changes, critical admin actions). This is separate from `data-provenance` to avoid bloat.

**On-chain state:**

* Event logs: list of (eventHash, timestamp, actor, eventType)

**Key functions:**

* `log-event(eventHash, eventType)` — writes an immutable audit entry.

**Notes:**

* Keep events minimal (hash of event payload stored off-chain). Useful for compliance audits.

---

## 9) Escrow / Refunds Contract (`escrow`) — optional

**Purpose:** manage more complex payment flows: escrow release on milestones, refunds, dispute resolution.

**Key functions:**

* `create-escrow(payer, payee, amount, conditions)`
* `release-escrow(escrowId)` — on oracle confirmation
* `refund(escrowId)` — on dispute resolution

**Notes:**

* Implement only if you need complex commercial flows. Simple `payments` + `oracle-bridge` is often enough for MVP.

---

# 🔗 Typical On-chain ↔ Off-chain Job Flow (high level)

1. User uploads sequence via frontend; backend stores file off-chain (S3/IPFS), computes `sequenceHash`.
2. Frontend triggers `payments.pay-for-job(user, jobId, serviceType)` to escrow payment.
3. Backend submits job to analysis pipeline (Python), tracks jobId locally.
4. When analysis finishes, backend/oracle publishes result to `oracle-bridge.oracle-report(jobId, resultHash, metadata)`; oracle writes on-chain.
5. `oracle-bridge` calls `payments.release-payment(jobId)` to transfer funds to provider; `data-provenance.record-sequence-proof` records the proof.
6. Frontend fetches results by calling backend API which returns analysis JSON and on-chain proof links.

---

# 🛡 Security, Privacy & Compliance (critical)

* **Never store raw genomic data or PHI on-chain.** Only store cryptographic hashes and minimal metadata.
* **Consent management:** store consent flags on-chain only as hashed pointers; the actual consent record (signed form) is off-chain under secure storage.
* **Access control:** use `access-control` for role checks; never make sensitive pointers public by default.
* **Oracle trust model:** for critical clinical actions (e.g., releasing payments), consider multi-oracle confirmation or off-chain governance confirmation for high-risk jobs.
* **Auditability:** use `audit-log` to record admin actions, role grants, and major contract calls.
* **Testing:** write comprehensive Clarity unit tests, run formal verification on critical contracts (payments, access-control).
* **Upgradability pattern:** Clarity contracts are immutable once deployed. Use contract registry patterns (store addresses in a registry contract) and design upgrade processes via governance so you can point to new implementations when needed.
* **Gas/cost minimization:** minimize on-chain storage; prefer event-style logs (hashes) and keep heavy metadata off-chain.
* **Regulatory:** design flows for data deletion/erasure requests that comply with GDPR — store off-chain with the ability to delete data while leaving a record of deletion hash on-chain.

---

# 🧪 Testing & QA Plan (recommended)

* **Unit tests:** for every contract function (happy paths + failure modes).
* **Integration tests:** simulate full job flow (frontend → payments → analysis → oracle → release).
* **Fuzz testing:** input unexpected data to ensure rejections.
* **Security audits:** external audit for payments & access-control before any production deployment.
* **Staging:** deploy identical contract set on testnet; use testnet oracles & wallets for end-to-end validation.

---

# 🧩 Integration Notes for stacks.js / Frontend & Backend

* Use `stacks.js` to sign transactions from the frontend (e.g., `buy-credits`, `submit-job` where user action is required).
* Backend (oracle) should use a server wallet principal for oracle calls (secure key storage; use HSM or secure KMS).
* Keep UI flows transparent: show transaction IDs, block links, and proof hashes so clinicians can verify immutability.

---

# ✅ Summary / Quick Checklist

* [ ] Create small, single-purpose Clarity contracts (data provenance, payments, access control, oracle bridge).
* [ ] Keep all raw genomic data off-chain; store only hashes and pointers on-chain.
* [ ] Oracle is essential (off-chain analysis → on-chain proof).
* [ ] Implement escrow/payment flow with oracle-driven release.
* [ ] Build robust access & consent model for clinical use.
* [ ] Plan for testing, audits, and a clear upgrade/governance path.

If you want, next I can:

* Draft **detailed contract interface documents** (function names, parameter descriptions, expected return values — still without code), or
* Produce **sequence diagrams** of typical interactions (user upload → escrow → analysis → oracle → release), or
* Draft a **Clarity testing checklist** for each contract.

Which of those would help you most next?

Perfect — let’s carefully walk through **all three categories of Clarity smart contracts** that your genomic analysis + healthcare + research platform might need. I’ll expand each category into a structured blueprint of what contracts would exist, their roles, and how they connect to Stacks blockchain, frontend, backend, and oracles.

---

## **1. Core Platform Smart Contracts**

These are the foundational contracts every blockchain-powered app like yours will need.

* **User Identity & Access Contract**

  * Manages registration of users (clinics, researchers, students, hospitals, small labs, farmers, etc.).
  * Links blockchain wallet to identity type.
  * Tracks roles (admin, researcher, patient, educator).

* **Subscription / Access Control Contract**

  * Users (clinics or researchers) pay STX to access premium analysis tools.
  * Supports both one-time payment and recurring subscription models.
  * Implements access tiers: free (basic reports), paid (advanced analytics, mutation prediction, etc.).

* **Data Registry Contract**

  * Securely registers uploaded datasets (DNA, RNA, pathogen sequences).
  * Stores metadata only (e.g., dataset hash, owner, timestamp) to avoid privacy issues.
  * Links dataset to access permissions from the Subscription Contract.

---

## **2. Healthcare & Research Workflow Contracts**

These contracts power the actual genomic + medical use cases.

* **Clinical Analysis Contract**

  * Links genomic dataset hashes to analysis requests.
  * Patients/clinics submit samples, request results, and lock in payment.
  * Analysis runs off-chain (Python + Node backend), then results hash gets committed on-chain.

* **Drug Resistance Prediction Contract**

  * Stores resistance profile data linked to DNA sequences.
  * Researchers or clinics query contract to confirm whether a sample matches a known resistant strain.
  * Rewards contributors who upload validated resistance data.

* **Research Collaboration Contract**

  * Enables group investing or pooled funding for genomic projects (like we discussed before).
  * Teams can stake STX into a project pool, distribute rewards equally among contributors.
  * Supports milestone-based unlock of funds.

---

## **3. Support & Expansion Smart Contracts**

These are auxiliary contracts that make the platform sustainable and extensible.

* **Oracle Contract**

  * Connects Stacks blockchain to external computation services (Python ML models, Evo2-like systems, etc.).
  * Receives computed results from off-chain (via trusted oracle operator).
  * Validates and posts back results hash to blockchain.

* **Reputation / Validation Contract**

  * Tracks reliability of clinics, labs, and researchers contributing data.
  * Users gain reputation scores based on accurate submissions.
  * Reputation determines future access discounts or rewards.

* **Education Token Contract**

  * Mints learning tokens for students and trainees who complete tutorials (e.g., learn how to analyze DNA).
  * Tokens can be exchanged for platform credits or access to premium datasets.

---

✅ **Summary**
So the **three clarity smart contract categories** for your project are:

1. **Core Platform Contracts** (identity, access, payments, data registry).
2. **Healthcare & Research Workflow Contracts** (analysis, drug resistance, collaboration).
3. **Support & Expansion Contracts** (oracle, reputation, education tokens).

---

Would you like me to **map these into a phased roadmap** (simple → medium → complex) so you’ll know which contracts to implement first and which ones to add later?
