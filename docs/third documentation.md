Perfect üëå ‚Äî now we switch gears into the **technical roadmap**. Since you don‚Äôt want actual code yet, I‚Äôll give you the **big context / blueprint** of how the system should evolve across stages. This will tie together:

* **Frontend (Vite + React + TS + module.css + stacks.js)**
* **Backend (Node.js/Express + Python services if needed)**
* **Database (MongoDB or hybrid depending on data type)**
* **Clarity smart contracts + oracle**
* **Integration with genomics workflows**

# üåç Technical Roadmap ‚Äì Genomic Classical Analysis + Web3 Integration Platform

### **Phase 1: Core Frontend Setup**

* **Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + CSS Modules
* **Purpose**: Serve as entry point for users (clinics, researchers, students).
* **Sections**:

  * Home (intro to genomics + blockchain use case)
  * Docs (guides for clinicians, labs, researchers)
  * Upload (DNA/RNA sequence input or file upload)
  * Results (classical analysis outputs: alignments, mutations, statistics)
  * Business Ideas (entrepreneurial applications)
* **Dependency**: `stacks.js` integrated from the beginning to handle auth, wallet connections, and interactions with Clarity contracts.

---

### **Phase 2: Backend Foundations**

* **Stack**: Node.js + Express (core API), optional Python microservices (for sequence analysis).
* **Functions**:

  * Handle DNA/RNA data uploads.
  * Send jobs to analysis pipeline (classical algorithms: BLAST, Clustal, mutation scanning).
  * Store results in **MongoDB Atlas**.
* **Web3 dependency**: Smart contract interactions begin here:

  * Store hash of sequence upload on Stacks blockchain (immutability + provenance).
  * Tokenized credit system (users buy credits for analyses using Stacks token).

---

### **Phase 3: Smart Contract Layer (Clarity)**

* **Contracts**:

  * **Data Provenance Contract** ‚Üí Hashes and timestamps every sequence uploaded.
  * **Payment Contract** ‚Üí Handles micropayments in STX for each analysis job.
  * **Access Contract** ‚Üí Controls who can retrieve sensitive data (clinician, researcher, patient).
* **Frontend via stacks.js**:

  * Login with Stacks wallet.
  * Pay for analysis job.
  * Check smart contract record of their data analysis.

---

### **Phase 4: Oracle Integration**

* **Why**: Clarity is deterministic and cannot fetch DNA data directly.
* **Oracle Role**:

  * Connect off-chain pipelines (classical genomic tools, mutation analysis) to blockchain state.
  * Post verified analysis results back to the Clarity contract.
* **Implementation Plan**:

  * Build a lightweight Node.js oracle service.
  * When analysis is done, oracle writes back a result hash + metadata to Clarity.

---

### **Phase 5: Advanced Analysis Pipelines**

* **Classical Analysis Modules**:

  * Sequence alignment (BLAST/Clustal).
  * Mutation detection.
  * Drug resistance marker checks.
* **Python Layer**:

  * BioPython or custom mutation pipelines.
  * Can run inside containers (Docker, Runpod, etc.) for scalability.
* **Blockchain Connection**:

  * Each pipeline execution ‚Üí results stored off-chain (MongoDB) but **proof-of-existence on-chain**.

---

### **Phase 6: Expansion into Multiple Domains**

* Clinical module (drug resistance, clinical reporting).
* Education module (teaching genomics to students).
* Agriculture module (crop/animal genetics).
* Forensics module (DNA identification, legal reports).
* Global registry (patients opt-in to store data immutably with anonymization).

---

### **Phase 7: Scaling and Marketplace**

* **Tokenization**:

  * Platform token or STX integration for credits.
  * Marketplace where clinics/researchers buy/sell analysis workflows.
* **Multi-cloud**:

  * Run workloads on Google Colab, Runpod, AWS depending on scale.
* **Security**:

  * HIPAA/GDPR-ready with encryption + privacy-preserving workflows.

---

‚úÖ At this point, you‚Äôd have **one giant integrated platform**: classical analysis pipelines, blockchain-based provenance, tokenized payments, oracles for off-chain data, and multiple modules (clinical, research, education, agriculture, forensics).
