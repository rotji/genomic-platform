## 🎯 **Vision: Beyond Analysis to Creation**

While our platform starts with **classical genomic analysis** (mutation detection, alignment, resistance screening), the ultimate goal is to become a **complete genetic design ecosystem** that can both **analyze existing genetic material** and **generate entirely new genetic sequences** using cutting-edge AI models.

This transforms our platform from a "read-only" genomic analysis tool into a "read-write" genetic engineering powerhouse.
