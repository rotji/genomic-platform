Awesome — I’ve folded a **size-aware DNA/RNA strategy** into the whole system. Here’s the updated design you can drop into your docs (no code).

# DNA/RNA Storage–Aware System Design (Updated)

## 1) Data classes & handling paths

1. **Small (≤5 MB)** — short genes/fragments, plasmids

   * **Upload:** direct POST from browser
   * **Processing:** sync API → Python (memory OK)
   * **Store:** DB (document) + file store
   * **Chain:** store SHA-256/CID + metadata only

2. **Medium (5–500 MB)** — bacterial genomes, targeted panels

   * **Upload:** **chunked** (5–10 MB chunks) → resumable; pre-signed URLs
   * **Processing:** Python loads by **stream/blocks**; no full in-RAM
   * **Store:** S3/GCS/Blob or IPFS; DB holds manifest
   * **Chain:** file CID/hash + owner, consent flags, analysis result hash

3. **Large (≥0.5–200 GB)** — human WGS, deep RNA-seq

   * **Upload:** browser requests **multipart pre-signed upload** (or direct lab→bucket); checksum verified server-side
   * **Processing:** queued **batch jobs** (K8s/Runpod/Paperspace), **streaming I/O**; local NVMe scratch, no full load
   * **Store:** object storage with **lifecycle** (hot→warm→cold)
   * **Chain:** immutable proofs (dataset hash, pipeline+version hash, result hash)

---

## 2) End-to-end flow (size-aware)

1. **Initiate upload**

   * Frontend calls `/upload/init` with expected file size + type.
   * Backend returns: upload ID, strategy = {direct|chunked|multipart}, **pre-signed URLs**, expected chunk size, and a **content-hash seed** (salt).

2. **Transfer**

   * **Small:** one POST.
   * **Medium:** chunked uploads (id, index, size).
   * **Large:** S3 multipart; client or lab pipelines stream directly to bucket.

3. **Finalize**

   * Frontend calls `/upload/complete` with client-side rolling checksum + chunk list (Merkle roots optional).
   * Backend verifies ETags / checksums, builds **manifest** (file size, chunk digests, final SHA-256, optional CID), tags storage class.

4. **Register proof**

   * Backend (or Oracle) writes to **`data-registry.clar`**: dataset-hash, owner, storage pointer (CID/URL-hash), minimal metadata, consent reference.

5. **Submit analysis job**

   * `/analysis/submit` → job record includes **manifest pointer** + pipeline spec (name@version, refs).
   * **Payments/escrow** (if paid) via `payments/subscription-access.clar`.

6. **Compute**

   * Orchestrator spins a Python worker (GPU/CPU), mounts object store, **streams** FASTQ/BAM/FASTA in blocks; writes outputs to `/results/{jobId}/…` (VCF, QC, JSON).
   * Worker emits **result-hash** (VCF hash, report hash, pipeline digest).

7. **Attest & settle**

   * Oracle posts `oracle-bridge.clar::submit-oracle-result(jobId, resultHash, pipelineHash)` and triggers **escrow release**.
   * `data-provenance` (or same registry) logs result-hash linkage.

8. **Deliver**

   * Frontend fetches report summary JSON; downloads large artifacts via **time-limited signed URLs**.

---

## 3) API surface (no code, just shape)

* `POST /upload/init` → {uploadId, strategy, presignedUrls[], chunkSize, salt}
* `PUT  /upload/chunk` or direct to storage (client uses pre-signed URL)
* `POST /upload/complete` → {fileHash, cid?, manifestUrl, datasetId}
* `POST /analysis/submit` → {jobId, queueEta, escrowTxId?}
* `GET  /analysis/:jobId/status` → {state, progress%, resultIds[]}
* `GET  /results/:resultId` → {summary, signedUrls[]}
* `POST /consent` → capture consent (off-chain doc) + on-chain **consent hash**
* `POST /pay/subscribe` or `/pay/job` → stacks.js to `subscription-access.clar` / `payments.clar`

---

## 4) Data model updates (conceptual)

**DB: `files`**

* `_id, ownerId, size, type, storageProvider, bucketKey, storageClass`
* `manifest`: chunkCount, chunkSize, chunkHashes[], finalHash, cid?
* `status`: uploaded|verified|archived
* `retentionPolicy`: hot/warm/cold, ttl

**DB: `datasets`**

* `fileId, datasetHash (on-chain), consentRef, tags, lineage, version`

**DB: `jobs`**

* `datasetId, pipeline {name, version, refDB versions}, resources`
* `state, startedAt, finishedAt, resultHash, logsRef`

**DB: `results`**

* `jobId, artifacts [{type, key, hash}], summaryJson, resultHash (on-chain), reportVersion`

---

## 5) Smart contract interactions (minimal, privacy-safe)

* **`data-registry.clar`**

  * `record-dataset(hash, pointer-hash, owner, consent-hash)`
  * `link-result(dataset-hash, result-hash, pipeline-hash)`

* **`subscription-access.clar` / `payments.clar`**

  * pay-per-job escrow & subscription tiers

* **`oracle-bridge.clar`**

  * authorize oracle(s), accept `jobId/resultHash/pipelineHash`, emit event
  * (Optionally) multi-oracle quorum for clinical jobs

* **`access-control.clar` (later)**

  * roles & consent flags (as hashed pointers), public/private toggles

> **Never** store raw sequences on-chain. Only hashes + minimal metadata.

---

## 6) Python pipeline rules (large-safe)

* **Streaming I/O**: read FASTQ/BAM/FASTA in blocks (e.g., 4–32 MB).
* **Memory caps**: enforce via container limits; use local NVMe scratch for sort/index.
* **Deterministic outputs**: stable sorting; include **pipeline digest** (code + env hash) in results.
* **Chunk checksums**: verify against manifest; fail fast on mismatch.
* **Retry semantics**: idempotent steps; resume from last successful stage.

---

## 7) Security, privacy, compliance

* **PII/PHI off-chain** under HIPAA/GDPR controls; encrypt at rest; VPC-only buckets.
* **Signed URLs** (short TTL), least-privilege IAM, no public buckets.
* **Consent**: store signed consent docs off-chain; put **consent hash** on-chain.
* **Audit**: append-only logs; optional on-chain hash via `audit-log`.
* **Deletion**: support subject erasure → delete off-chain objects; on-chain keep a **tombstone hash** (no identifying data).
* **Deduplication**: compare content hashes; avoid duplicate storage/compute.

---

## 8) Cost & retention strategy

* **Lifecycle**: HOT (0–30d) → WARM (30–180d) → COLD/GLACIER (>180d).
* **Compression**: bgzip/CRAM where applicable; index for random access.
* **Caching**: keep derived results (VCF, summary JSON) hot; archive raw reads.
* **Egress minimization**: analyze **in-region** with workers inside same cloud/VPC.

---

## 9) UX adjustments

* Show **upload strategy** (direct/chunked/multipart) and estimated time.
* Resume failed uploads; show per-chunk progress & integrity checks.
* Post-upload verification step (checksums) with clear success/fail state.
* For very large jobs: queue position, ETA range, and on-chain proof links.

---

## 10) Optional enhancements

* **Merkle manifests** for chunk trees → easy partial verification.
* **Content addressing** everywhere (CID first).
* **Federated ingest**: allow labs to push from LIMS directly to bucket.
* **Multi-region replication** for regulated workloads.

---

### One-line summary

We treat DNA/RNA as **large, binary scientific data**—**stored off-chain**, **streamed for compute**, and **anchored on-chain with hashes**—so the platform stays private, scalable, verifiable, and affordable.

If you want, I can now turn this into a **print-ready doc page** for your `/docs/classical-analysis.md` and `/docs/technical-roadmap.md` sections.

Great question — because the **final output of DNA/RNA analysis** depends on the use case, here’s a clear breakdown of **what users will actually see/download/interact with** on your platform once a sequence has been processed.

# ✅ What’s Next?

I can now:

1. Convert these outputs into UI mockups
2. Link each one to its corresponding pipeline
3. Create backend response placeholder files
4. Map blockchain interactions per use case

Just tell me which step you want next.

Perfect ✅ — here’s how we’ll execute all **4 steps** in a clean, structured way so nothing gets mixed up.

---

# ✅ STEP 1 — UI MOCKUPS FOR EACH USE CASE

I’ll create visual mockups (no code yet) showing:

✅ User dashboard
✅ Upload panel
✅ Result summary page
✅ Detailed analysis report view
✅ Download/verify buttons
✅ Blockchain reference section
✅ Progress log (queued / analyzing / complete)

Each use case (7 total) gets its own layout preview.

**Output format:**

* Image mockups (PNG) OR
* Wireframe-style layouts (textual + visual)
  → You decide!

---

# ✅ STEP 2 — LINK EACH OUTPUT TO ITS PIPELINE

For every use case above, I’ll define:

✅ Pipeline Name
✅ Reference Genome/DB
✅ Input Type (FASTA/FASTQ/VCF/CSV)
✅ Main Scripts/Tools (Python)
✅ Output Formats
✅ Estimated Processing Model
✅ Storage + Tracking Method

This becomes your “Pipeline Index” file.

---

# ✅ STEP 3 — BACKEND RESPONSE PLACEHOLDERS

I’ll create **structured JSON schemas** for:

✅ Upload response
✅ Job submission response
✅ Status polling
✅ Final output metadata
✅ Result download endpoints
✅ Blockchain verification payload

(No implementation — just shape & naming conventions.)

Example:

```json
{
  "jobId": "JOB_12345",
  "datasetHash": "0xabcd...",
  "status": "processing",
  "estTime": "2min"
}
```

---

# ✅ STEP 4 — MAP BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION

For each use case with blockchain needs, I will define:

✅ Which contract is involved (data-registry, oracle, payment, etc.)
✅ What is stored (hash? CID? metadata?)
✅ Which Clarity function is triggered
✅ Frontend → stacks.js call structure
✅ Result verification flow
✅ Consent token / NFT (if needed)

Also grouped into:

* ✅ Basic on-chain proof
* ✅ Medium: payment + ownership
* ✅ Advanced: audit + oracle validation

---

# ✅ Before I begin, confirm ONE thing:

For **Step 1 UI mockups** —
Do you want:
1️⃣ **Image visuals** (generated screens)?
OR
2️⃣ **Text-based structured mockups** (sectioned UI outlines)?
OR
3️⃣ **Both (but one at a time)?**

Just reply with:

* **“Images”**
* **“Text”**
* **“Both”**
  and I’ll start immediately with Step 1.
